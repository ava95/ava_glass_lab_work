To Do:


Analysis

TF -> miRNA
- Analyze edges with low p-value in relation to fev1/fec
- Identify edges that are significantly different from L2P vs P2L (in beta and in pvalue)
- Largest connected component analysis
- Sort edges by weight and compare to sorted list of average weight in COPD vs not
- Some kind of network analysis?
- Check normality of weights in a given sample


miRNA x miRNA
- Analyze strongest edges over fev1/fec
- Sort edges by weight and compare to sorted list of average weight in COPD vs not
- Investigate the very high beta scores

Notes

Linear regression model with FEV after the fact
- Go to the base coding! 
- Implement regression model and start with that 
- Categorical variables vs continuous variables (pkyrs)

Motif prior & assumptions
- Which original region had a set 
- Merge promoters -- we find 4 are actually higher ranked, figure out miRNA was active 
- Dig into original data in message passing -- see if there's pairs close to 1
  - Evaluate in motif prior -- Jakart index, see if there's identical incoming edges
  - Could cause issues in the network building
  - Could have a real impact!

Integrating TF data
- Lots of genes!! TF info gets masked by gene expression

We have RNAseq data for some people
- Could go in PPI?

Motif -- when would it be something other than 1?
- 1 vs 0 dominates, but there's no reason not to have a weight!
- Can play around
